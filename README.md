# CEMA-Malaria-Classification-Model
A machine learning model used to classify malaria blood smear into either uninfected or parasitized. The model uses datasets from Tensorflow 'malaria' dataset as its test, train and validation sets. Later on the most accurate model will be loaded to a flutter flow application as a Tflite model and be used to classify images selected by the user.
